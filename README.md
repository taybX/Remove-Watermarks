Usage

Step 1: Select watermark area

Run the GUI script to select the area containing the watermark/logo:

python select_area.py

- A window will open showing a frame from the video
- Drag with the mouse to select the watermark region
- Coordinates will be saved automatically to selected_area.txt

Step 2: Remove watermark

Run the main script to remove the watermark and save the output:

python remove_watermark.py

- The script will read selected_area.txt for coordinates
- It will process the video frames and remove the watermark
- The output video with audio will be saved in the output folder
